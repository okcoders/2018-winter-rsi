# RSI React Course

In this course we will learn the tools needed to build modern web apps with
react.

### Some tools:

- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [routing](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [routing with redux](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)
- [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [antd](https://ant.design/)
- [redux thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11)


### Examplar Project

We will work together to make an examplar web app that utilizes all the tools we
learn. The app will be a resource platform, aggregating various books, videos,
and articles about a particular tech topic. It will need to support the
following:

- input from the user for the topic they are interested in. This could be in the
  form of free text, or selecting from a currated list
- integrating and retreiving items from various sources to get the latest/most
  popular matches based on the provided user search
- displaying that content to the user in a useful way (e.g if video, should be
  playable)
- user should interact with the results in some other way, perhaps save for
  later?

Some example sources to integrate with: 
- [stackoverflow](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs) 
- [youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Page_content/get_page_html_title)
- [news api](https://newsapi.org/)
