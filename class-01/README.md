## React Quick Start

## Create React App

Setting up a new react project requires stringing together a lot of technology
and packages to get a nice development environment. There is a repo called
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that is meant
to make that process much simpler.

For example if you run:
```
npx create-react-app exemplar-project
```

npx only exists in newer versions of node, so if the above command doesn't work
you will need to do the following:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app exemplar-project
```

Once that is done you will have a new folder with a lot of stuff in it. Create
react app went ahead and gave us a basic template to start making a new app with
react, and also gave us a nice development workflow with a server that
autorefreshes, and a nice testing framework called jest.
