# Class 3

At this point we have learned react to a point that a lot of people stop at. You
can make some pretty complicated applications with what you know. The below are
things you don't need to master. The people that have mastered them are using
these patterns to create libraries for react.

It just so happens that the new libs we are learning today use almost all these
patterns

### The patterns

- [higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
- [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
